A discord bot template generator to help create discord
bots quickly and easily. Forget about the boilerplate
and focus on what really matters, what your bot will do.

Bot Box is built using Golang, Cobra, and Huh,
offering an intuitive cli tool to quickly build
Discord bot projects. It includes a cog-based architecture, ` +
		"`.env`" + ` management, and built-in utilities for automating
bot configuration and extension development.
