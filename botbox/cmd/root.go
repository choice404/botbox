bots quickly and easily. Forget about the boilerplate
and focus on what really matters, what your bot will do.

**Bot Box** is built using Python and `discord.py`,
offering a boilerplate codebase for quickly building
Discord bot projects. It includes a cog-based architecture,
`.env` management, and built-in utilities for automating
bot configuration and extension development.
